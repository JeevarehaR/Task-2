Difference between Window and Document:

The window command are the Web APIs that the browser has. 
The document, on the other hand, is used for DOM manipulation to modify the HTML.

1.Window:
	window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript.
	Each browser tab has its own top-level window object. 
	Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>) element has its own window object too, nested within a parent window. 
	Each of these windows gets its own separate global object. 
	window.window always refers to window, but window.parent and window.top might refer to enclosing windows, giving access to other execution contexts. 
	In addition, window properties include:
		*setTimeout() and setInterval() binding event handlers to a timer
		*location giving the current URL
		*history with methods back() and forward() giving the tab's mutable history
		*navigator describing the browser software
2.Document:
	A document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML
	Each window object has a document object to be rendered. 
	These objects get confused in part because HTML elements are added to the global object when assigned a unique id. 
	E.g.,
	<body>
  		<p id="Jeeva"> This is the first paragraph.</p>
	</body>
	In the HTML snippet,the paragraph element can be referenced by any of the following:
		*window.Jeeva or window["Jeeva"]
		*document.getElementById("Jeeva")
		*document.querySelector("#Jeeva")
		*document.body.firstChild
		*document.body.children[0]
